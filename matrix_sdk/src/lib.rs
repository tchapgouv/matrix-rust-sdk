//! This crate implements a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) client library.
//!
//! # Enabling logging
//!
//! Users of the matrix-sdk crate can enable log output by depending on the `tracing-subscriber`
//! crate and including the following line in their application (e.g. at the start of `main`):
//!
//! ```rust
//! tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();
//! ```
//!
//! The log output is controlled via the `RUST_LOG` environment variable by setting it to one of
//! the `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` or `trace` levels. The output is printed to stdout.
//!
//! The `RUST_LOG` variable also supports a more advanced syntax for filtering log output more
//! precisely, for instance with crate-level granularity. For more information on this, check out
//! the [tracing_subscriber
//! documentation](https://tracing.rs/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.envfilter).
//!
//! # Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available:
//!
//! * `encryption`: Enables end-to-end encryption support in the library.
//! * `sled_cryptostore`: Enables a Sled based store for the encryption
//! keys. If this is disabled and `encryption` support is enabled the keys will
//! by default be stored only in memory and thus lost after the client is
//! destroyed.
//! * `unstable-synapse-quirks`: Enables support to deal with inconsistencies
//! of Synapse in compliance with the Matrix API specification.
//! * `markdown`: Support for sending markdown formatted messages.
//! * `socks`: Enables SOCKS support in reqwest, the default HTTP client.
