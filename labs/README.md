# Experiments

This directory contains experiments, work-in-progress crates, or other code and documentation, that
do not fall under the same stability guarantees as the main crates (`matrix-sdk`,
`matrix-sdk-crypto`, etc.).

Lab projects might be abandoned and possibly removed at any time.

---

That said, this directory is meant to freely explore unconventional or interesting ways the Matrix
Rust SDK can evolve, feel free to propose an experiment.

## Current experiments

TBD
